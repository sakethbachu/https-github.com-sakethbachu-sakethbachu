# About me
* Hello, this is Saketh Bachu, just another deep learning enthusiast. I am a third year undergraduate student at [Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur](http://vnit.ac.in/). I am also a part of [IvLabs](https://www.ivlabs.in/) ( The Robotics and AI lab of VNIT ), this is where I fell in love with AI:heart_eyes:	

* The topics of my interest include: Deep learning, Computer vision, Image processing, and Mathematics.

* I am very keen on following research that is being done on the above mentioned fields, and the practical usage of the research excites me.

* I tried to solve a couple of real-life problems with the help of my fields of interest and more information can be gathered from my repositories.
